\section{Stakeholder Research}
After consultation with the main stakeholders (museum visitors and staff), and exhibit owners, a better understanding was gained concerning the need shown in the market. Out of the 21 responses received, 15 potential users admitted to visiting museums at least once a month; showing some level of frequency in their visits, and that something can be offered to this group of people.

Since the concept principally considers the use of navigation in museums, when users were asked, 

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{"Do you find yourself using the maps in the museum more than once?"}
\end{displayquote}

100\% of visitors agreed they referred to the maps around the museum multiple times, and some respondents over 10 times. However, these maps are not free; most museums, including the Natural History Museum, and Science Museum in London, charge a fee of Â£1.

18 of the respondents agreed they preferred using their phone to navigate rather than the paper maps, outlining a clear need for an accessible tool other than the maps around the museum.

\section{Project Requirements}
Based on the stakeholder research, the project requirements are, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Display navigational routes in real-time.
    \item Calculate the shortest route to the user specified location.
    \item Use AR to enhance user navigation routing.
    \item Contain accessibility features such as inverted colours.
\end{itemize}

\section{Museum Staff Requirements}
Another key stakeholder are museum staff as they are instrumental to on-the-ground navigational assistance. The platform should endeavour to make it easier for museum staff to assist visitors.

The museum staff stakeholder requirements are,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exhibit an effective and easy-to-use design. 
    \item Be economic and effective in its use of data, as most data would be sourced from the museum Wi-Fi. 
    \item Written content and other media to be controlled by the museum.
\end{itemize}

During the field research, museum-floor staff and receptionists were consulted. The staff approached all received navigational inquiries, either from themselves or visitors. Although positive responses were received several concerns were cited,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Battery performance
    \item Data usage
    \item Ease of use
\end{itemize}
