    \item How will the navigation system get me from point A to point B?\\\\
    In order for user to get from one point to another, it will use route calculation to calculate the quickest route.\\\\
    Back/Front-End Route Calculations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Algorithms to request and process GPS signal.
        \item Algorithms to calculation quickest route when user enter their destination.
        \item Once calculate shows the result for user to start the journey.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item How easy will the app be for me to grasp? \\
    
    The app layout would be simple and the basic map/guidance means it will work straightforwardly. Once the destination has been calculated, a 3D line would be superimposed on the users screen.
    
    \item When I open the app, what will I see?\\\\
    When user open our application, the first thing he/she will see our main page? (Sign In, Register as New User, Continue as Guest, Service Utilities etc.)
    
    \item Can the app be used without Internet?\\\\
    No, because the app wouldn't have access to the user's real time location and would take up too much storage space on the user's device if it was used without.
