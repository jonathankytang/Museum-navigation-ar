# Presentation Notes
###### Monday 10th December 2018

## What is the concept?
* Augmented reality navigation in museums on a mobile device
* Superimposing line onto user's device in real time with the user's device camera
* First came about in 1960s but gained recent consumer attention recently through Snapchat and games
* Two scenarios
    * Route user from A to B
    * Recognising artwork with user's camera

## Who are the stakeholders?
* Museum visitors and staff

## What is there already on the market like your concept?
* Current solutions on the market cater well for basic navigation of large public spaces, but fails to display an even proportion of navigational and interactive content with will-presented data.
* Most museums use portable audio guides, one company provides bespoke solutions but difficult for people to use and setup
* Nothing specific for indoor museum navigation

## Do you have a functional and technical architecture? Briefly describe the core functional components and technologies to be used.
* Use case model outlines different scenario
* Activity model outlines the flow of the system 
* Technical arcitecture - MVC
* ARCore by Google
* Developed on Android using Java
* Core functional components
    * Route calculations
    * Superimposition
    * Suggestions

## Do you have any conceptual/functional prototypes? What did you learn from them?
* Built three AR prototypes to research which library could help with implementation
* Overall, realised a lot of methods have already been created in AR library
    * Vulforia, ARKit, ARCore
* Three UI designs shown to stakeholders, positive aspects from all three combined into one
