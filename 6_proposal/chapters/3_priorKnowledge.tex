\section{Current Solutions \& Competitors}
The market of indoor museum navigation has become more competitive in recent years with solutions being submitted due to a growth in indoor navigational research. Most solutions on the market cater well for a basic navigation of large public spaces, but fails to display an even proportion of navigational and interactive content with well-presented data.\\

Since most museums use portable audio guides, user experiences can be vastly improved by mobile devices. Currently only a few solutions can be found; the Orpheo group \cite{orpheo} provide a unique app for each place; their solution is somewhat cumbersome to regular museumgoers who wish to have a hassle-free setup. As the aim is to appeal to museums, having an application whereby the user can walk into a museum or exhibition, and be greeted with relevant information is vital in comparison \cite{microsoft}.\\

If museums wanted a solution for navigation, due to the low number of museum-specific competitors, would choose to use a standard indoor mapping software \cite{engadget}. However, while there are many options out there from Google and Mapspeople \cite{mapspeople} who try to provide this, they lack exigencies that are imperative for museums like heavily integrated AR, intelligent tour guiding from your location, and virtual reality to take a scene from the museum, for instance, and place the user to the artefact's original time and place.\\

From a technological point of view, an apparent problem in the solutions that museums implement today, would be their paper maps not processing real-time locations. AR allows for real-time data processing, picking up the user's current location, and displaying the best route for the user to take through their device's camera. One huge benefit of implementing AR is the unique approach to today's navigation solutions, whilst also allowing for user's to create their own content enabling more opportunities to interact with the application.
