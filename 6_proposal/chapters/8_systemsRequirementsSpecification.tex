%This bring summarise and bring together all the previous section into a specification that should be fully expanded in the appendix with the following points, in providing what is known as the System Requirements Specification (SRS). This collects various information that you have previously agreed and worked on such as the UML diagrams.

% 1. Purpose
% 2. Scope

\subsection{The System Requirement Specification (SRS)}

The SRS was designed to describe all data, functional and behavioral requirements of the platform. Covering the overall description of the system to be implemented, including the purpose and scope of the system, use cases and scenarios, functional and non-functional requirements, as well as constraints on the system.\\

The functional requirements comprise the behaviour of the system, the functions and features (\textit{what} the system should do), whereas the non-functional requirements place constraints on \textit{how} the system should do it.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The functional requirements are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Needs to be able to navigate the user from point A to B.
        \item The app should be able to display navigational routes in real time.
        \item It should be able to calculate the quickest route.
        \item A 3D line will be superimposed that navigates the user to their destination
        \item The userâ€™s camera can recognise artwork/objects, displaying further information about the piece.
        \item when user arrives to their destination, the app will give recommendation based on their current route.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The non-functional requirements are 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Performance -  The app should have quick response whenever a user wants to find more information about an art piece or whenever they search up a location. As well as that, it should not slow down their phone to avoid negative impacts.
        \item Usability - The app would be layout simple, there would be some colours used for appropriate purpose. The language used on the app would be easy to understand for the users. Having done research based on the user preference, it was discover that users tend to dislike having too much displayed on their menu screen all out once. Therefore, the app would take the user step by step to make it more user friendly.
        \item Data Usage - the app would need internet connection in order for it to work out the real time distance and the length of the final destination.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Constraints, Assumptions and Dependencies}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Internet Connection}: The application would not be able to query mapping services or have access to exhibit information otherwise.
        \item \textbf{Android}: Users of this application are any Android device user that requires assistance in museum navigation. An android device that can support basic dependencies of the application is expected for proper user experience.
