% This bring summarise and bring together all the previous section into a specification that should be fully expanded in the appendix with the following points, in providing what is known as the System Requirements Specification (SRS). This collects various information that you have previously agreed and worked on such as the UML diagrams.

% SRS contents:
% 1. Purpose
% 2. Scope
% 3. System Overview
% 4. References
% 5. Definitions
% 6. Use Cases
% 7. Functional requirements
% 8. Non-functional requirements.

The SRS was designed to show the structured collection of the requirements of the system and its operational environments and external interfaces \cite{IEEE24765}. 

The functional requirementsc (FR) comprise of the system behaviour, the functions and features (\textit{what} the system should do), whereas the non-functional requirements (NFR) place constraints on \textit{how} the system should do it.

The FR considers the functionality of the application, looking at the key features such as the user navigation and its relative implications. The NFR considers the usability of the application, describing aspects such as performance, user actions and data usage.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Constraints, Assumptions and Dependencies}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Internet Connection}: The application would not be able to query mapping services or have access to exhibit information otherwise.
        \item \textbf{Android}: Users of this application are Android device users that requires assistance in museum navigation. An android device that can support basic dependencies of the application is expected for proper user experience.
