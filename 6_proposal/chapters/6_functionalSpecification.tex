% The essential functional elements should be defined and described, including data paths. This functional specification should not assume any specific technologies, only functional technologies (e.g. short range wireless technology is a functional statement whilst Bluetooth is a specific technology)

% I don't think you need this section at all, you just need one line on "There are several essential functional elements in the project including..."

Functional specification describes the important technical requirements for a system. It also includes the procedures in which the requirements have been met.

In this section, we are breaking down the functional specifications of our idea and how it should respond to a given task:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system should extract the user's current location and their destination, this is key as it allows the app to calculate the route.
    \item Then it'll calculate the most efficient route to a given exhibition in a desirably short period of time.
    \item Therefore giving the display function the ability to superimpose a 3D line ( over their camera ) that navigates the user towards their destination. 
    \item Once their destination's been reached, the system will recognise this and the ability to review/rate the journey ( and the app if they haven't done so yet ) will be available. Along with this, the user will be shown a number of other possible options and exhibitions they can possibly wonder towards.
\end{enumerate}
