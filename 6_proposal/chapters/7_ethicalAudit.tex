AR is currently not heavily regulated in the UK owing to the emergence of this new technology. Areas such as data protection, and intellectual property (IP) need to be strongly considered during the development lifecycle. It should be noted that AR will involve collecting extensive amounts of data per user such as names and address, but also real time location, interactions with other users. Within the scope of this project, we will not be working with minors and vulnerable adults. Since the concept of the project relies on the user's camera, accelerometer, and location data on the user's device, ensuring this data cannot be obtained unlawfully, and fits the scope of the Data Protection Act (1998) along with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is of most importance.\cite{ITProPortal}\\

Based on large virtual reality companies such as Oculus, these obligations are addressed by the form of a privacy policy in order to detail how data is collected, used and if it is shared with third parties. Since GDPR presents many pitfalls for developers, it is critical these regulatory issues are addressed before the completion of the product and not after.\\

Another regulatory standard is the IP of the software. The source code that serves as the underlying foundation of the platform will be be original and qualify for copyright protection. Since computer software is usually excluded from patentability in the UK, any ideas that uses AR producing a technical effect, and its associated hardware can be protected by patents. Based on our competitors, it is important that we do not infringe on their patents owned by third parties. Equally, if the concept makes new technical developments in the AR field, then it should be considered whether it would be eligible for patent protection.\\

% Given that the AR experience is built using a database of information about the real world, the database can be protected by copyright. The concept could take on a machine learning viewpoint by recognising third party logos captured on the user's camera. This could cause an infringement claim since AR could be replicating, replacing trademark or copyright works, or distorting the logo.\\
