% How you will manage the development process: milestones, Gantt charts, roles, development methodology etc.

In order to manage the development process, the agile methodology using the scrum framework will be employed. In the scrum team, the project supervisor will serve as product owner, acting as the primary liaison for the project, and ensuring the key stakeholders' vision are at the forefront of decisions made by the team.\\

The project manager will serve as scrum master, coordinating the scrum team, and managing scrum processes such as sprint planning, execution, and review. They will lead daily stand-up meetings, and decision-making processes so that any impediments that affect the team are removed efficiently. The scrum team, and the scrum master are responsible for all actions in the sprints; prioritising items in the backlog for sprint planning \cite{scrumroles}.\\

A Gantt chart will be used to visually represent sprints and progress made. Trello will host the scrum board to track sprints, and other deadlines such as module milestones. Any specific development issues will be tracked on Gitlab so that they can be easily attributed to the affected code. For each repository commit that happens, a code review will take place by other team members before integration. This is to ensure there is a high level of consistency, maintainability, and secure code across the implementation and testing of the project.
