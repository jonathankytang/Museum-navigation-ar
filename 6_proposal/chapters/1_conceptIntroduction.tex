The main concept for this project revolves around the use of augmented reality navigation on smartphones. Augmented reality (AR) is the superimposing of a computer-generated image onto a user's view of the real world \cite{oxforddict}. This technology first came about in the 1960s \cite{InteractionDesign} but has recently gained wide-spread consumer and media attention after the use of on Snapchat filters \cite{Snapchat} and the 2016 game \textit{Pok√©mon Go} for example. There have been many times where people get lost in unfamiliar spaces such as a museum, immersed by the culture around them, and their sense of direction. This project aims to tackle this issue by allowing users to restore their orientation by having a mobile platform to route users to their destination, using AR. The platform will use the device's camera to work out its surrounding, and will produce a highlighted line on the screen to their destination in real time.\\

This concept has various applications to other similar scenarios such as finding products in a supermarket, books in a library, or even valuable items that people own that can emit an electronic signal for it to be tracked down. Further, the concept could also use machine learning in identifying user's traits in places visited in a museum in order to give personalised recommendations at other similar exhibitions.
