The main concept for this project revolves around the use of augmented reality (AR) navigation on smartphones. AR is the superimposing of a computer-generated image onto a user's view of the real world \cite{oxforddict}. This technology first came about in the 1960s \cite{InteractionDesign} but recently gained wide-spread consumer attention after the use of it on Snapchat filters \cite{Snapchat}, and the 2016 game \textit{Pok√©mon Go}. People get lost in unfamiliar spaces such as a museum, immersed by the culture around them, and their sense of direction. This project aims to tackle this issue by allowing users to restore their orientation by having an AR platform, routing users to their destination. The platform will use the device's camera to work out its surrounding, and produce a highlighted line on the screen to their destination in real time.\\

This concept has various applications to other scenarios such as finding products in a supermarket, or books in a library. Further, the concept could also use machine learning in identifying user traits in places visited in a museum in order to give personalised recommendations at other similar exhibitions.
