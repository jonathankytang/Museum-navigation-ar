\section*{Test Driven Development (TDD)}

TDD will be the main testing process both during, and after creation because of the following. 

\subsection*{1. Tangible results reviewed with efficacy}
As a test based method, it allows the ability to adapt, and prove what works. For example, the application requires a guiding graphic. TDD makes it easy to review whether a 3D line, is the best case solution. Or whether an alternative, such as an arrow, is better.

\subsection*{2. Simplicity of implementation}
The application as a concept, is straightforward, but is relatively difficult to manifest because of the technical complexities. To have a simple way to evaluate the application makes it easier to create. TDD can assist with the complexities of the route calculations. For example, when choosing the best route. Does the algorithm place more weight on scalar distance? Or on obstacles? TDD makes the process of making this decision distinct.

\subsection*{3. Re-usability}
The ability to iterate over multiple prototypes and algorithms with TDD makes the process of fulfilling those few purposes simpler. It also means they can be achieved with a high degree of quality.
