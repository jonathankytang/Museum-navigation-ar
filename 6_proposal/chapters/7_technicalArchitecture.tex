% Having validated the proposed solution with users and answered any open technical or feasibility questions, attribute specific technologies to the functional architecture and present this as a technical architecture. Justify your choice of technologies with reasoned arguments for rejecting or retaining alterative technologies.

\section{Means of Software Development}

\subsection*{SDKs}
Google's \textbf{ARCore} kit gives the ability to apply AR to the application without having to spend time pre-defining AR methods. It has distinct advantages over Apple's ARKit as ARCore can detect horizontal surfaces that is similar to motion tracking, and can accurately anchor virtual objects. \cite{newgenapps}

\subsection*{Platform \& Languages}
The app will be developed on Android since it is only useable with ARCore. Java is imperative to the project since Android development is only possible in this language.

\subsection*{IDE}
Android Studio will be utilised because it involves a number of relevant exclusive packages. Other IDEs requires them to be pre-defined, and therefore takes out valuable time from application development.

\subsection*{Architectural Pattern}
The application fits under the MVC (Figure~\ref{fig:MVC}) pattern perfectly be it that the following are true.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model: Data provided by the user (e.g. geolocational data)
    \item View: Front-end interface (e.g. 3D line to location)
    \item Controller: Algorithms between the model \& view (e.g. route calculation)
\end{itemize}
The pattern's simplicity makes the most sensible one we can use.

\section{Satisfying Questions From the User Stories}
\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How will the navigation system get me from point A to point B? (Figure~\ref{fig:AtoB})\\\\
    In order for users to get from one point to another, the quickest route will be calculated.\\
    Route Calculations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Algorithms to request, and process GPS signal.
        \item Algorithms to calculation quickest route when user enter their destination.
        \item Once calculated, show the result for user to start their journey.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item How easy will it be to grasp the app?\\\\
    The basic map layout will be simple, and once the route has been calculated, a 3D line will be superimposed on the users screen to direct the user.
    
    \item Can the app be used without Internet? \\\\
    No, otherwise the app would not have access to the user's GPS location, and would take up too much storage space on the user's device otherwise.
