% Having validated the proposed solution with users and answered any open technical or feasibility questions, attribute specific technologies to the functional architecture and present this as a technical architecture. Justify your choice of technologies with reasoned arguments for rejecting or retaining alterative technologies.

\section*{Means of Software Development}    
\underline{\textbf{IDE}} : \underline{Android Studio}
\newline
The \underline{Android Studio} is the only development IDE we'll be utilising because it involves a number of relevant exclusive packages and libraries - that if we were to use other IDEs, would have to be defined and therefore take valuable time from our development of the application itself.
\newline
\newline
\underline{\textbf{Languages}} : \underline{Java \& SQL}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Java is distinctly imperative to the project due to the fact that android app development is almost only possible in this language.
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Architectural Pattern}} : \underline{MVC (Model-View-Controller)}
\newline
\newline
Our application fits under the MVC pattern perfectly be it that the following are true.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model = The data provided by the user (example : geolocational data)
    \item View = The front-end interface (example : 3D line to location)
    \item Controller = The algorithms between M\&V (example : route calculation)
\end{itemize}
Along with the fact above, the pattern's simplicity makes the most sensible one we can use.
\newline
\newline
\underline{\textbf{SDKs \& Packages}} : \underline{ARCore}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ARCore kit by Google gives us the ability to apply the AR element of our application without having to spend time pre-defining AR methods ourselves.
\end{itemize}
