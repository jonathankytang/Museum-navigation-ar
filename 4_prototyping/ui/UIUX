UI/UX Prototyping 
Our project lends substantial importance to its user interface and experience. As our project will be used from a wide cross section of technical ability, the absolute aim for our UI/UX feature will be to make the use of our project as simple and easy to use as possible without this having an impinging effect on any major service the end project will feature. This prerequisite was clearly outlined in our surveying of museum guests and staff alike. Our first mission was to determine what interfaces and experiences current exists within the museum sector. Many museums did employ simple interfaces but due to their mass-manufacturing, their design felt unoptimized, slow and clunky, with simple barebones media not beyond text and images. Furthermore, this design would fail to deliver anything more complex than text and image. 
  
Our approach to the UX/UI prototyping was to create a score of different complete interface mockups and exhibit them alongside existing solutions. Three team members independently drew up mockeries of a potential interface. These candidates were then put to stakeholders and all received positive attributes were combined into one.
