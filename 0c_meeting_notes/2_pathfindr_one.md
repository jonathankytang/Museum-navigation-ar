# Pathfindr Meeting

## GPS
- GPS indoor not very reliable

## Bluetooth
- Bluetooth beacon
    - estimate
    - proximity beacon
        - not to the absolute distance
- most cost effective
- through raspberry pi
- individual desk level/25m range

## Optical Solutions
- Rear/forward facing for marker like QR code
- All stored locally on device
- Lo-fi solutions

## Other things
- Indoor challenge not completely met currently (e.g. by Google)
- Infra-red approach, differency frequency & delta
    - Point A to point B, not cost effective
- Estimate using accelerometer between markers
- 2D top-down map for displaying optimal route?
- Finite number of routes - do natively
    - Calculate peak times in certain spaces
- Work with environment & orientation
    - Know you fix beacons

## QA
For UX
- A/B testing
- In field testing
- Azure wireframing prototypes

Development
- 2 weeks of tuning location
- Monitor data from users to find optimal performance
