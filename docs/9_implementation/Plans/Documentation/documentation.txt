Sprint 1 - Bluetooth

- understanding mechanics of bluetooth, find modules
- found route calculations
- logging bluetooth signals

Sprint 2 - Route Calculations
- finding solution to problem
- debugging in their code (legacy program)
- problems with manifest and layout files, solved by hard coding horizontal and vertical dimensions
- finding the algorithm for the article in relation to the user
- more debugging, different approach, graph approach taken using A* algorithm 
- went back to debugging code, didn't have manifest file - created user permission
- didn't give two entities as we aren't using a server and database in the mvp 
- back to graph strategy, formative approach to creating solution
	- phone realises it's gone 10m forward
	- phone realises where it's gone
	- turn 10m to a graph
	- do same first 2 things in a graphical context
	- map out room with graph
	- go from door to door with graph
