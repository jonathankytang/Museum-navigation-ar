\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the Deployment Plan is to ensure that the system successfully reaches its users.
The aim of a deployment plan is to provide  a detailed schedule events, persons responsible, and dependencies required to integrate the new version of the app with the previous version.
Deployment can be really stressful to the customers since there are many changes that take place, therefore to avoid any compplains it has to be smooth and simple. The Deployment Plan should minimize the impact of the integration of the new system on the users and stakeholders.
\subsection{Assumptions}
The application would have a place for users to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have a login activity, where the user can enter credentials to login. Or continue as a guest.
    \item To login to the application, enter their location and destination.
    \item Route calcuation takes place (finding the shortest route to the destination).
    \item The user can retrieve their current location and map.
    \item The user can take a quick snap of a exhibit and the application would provide more information about it.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dependencies}
Dependencies that can hinder or slow the process of deployment are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dependent on using an Android device
    \item Dependent on Google's ARCore Software Development Kit (SDK)
    \item Dependent on Google's Map services
    \item Unavoidable change of plans
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Change of user requirements
        \item Research fails
        \item Implementation fails
    \end{itemize}
    \item Time management
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Group meeting
        \item Supervisor meeting
        \item Weekly delegated tasks
        \item Milestones
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reliance with Google's map services (Server can crash)
    \item File sharing: https://gitlab.doc.gold.ac.uk could be down
    \item Group member availability:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not all members are mutually available
        \item Conflicting time schedules
    \end{itemize}
    \item Internet Connection/Wi-Fi issues
    \item Database error: Existing accounts may not be able to login if the DB server is down
\end{itemize}

\subsection Assessment of Deployment Readiness
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify that the application does not have any broken links and that all content is accessible.
    \item Verify that all dependent files have been uploaded to the relevant directories so that they can be accessed from other calls.
    \item Supervisor approval (Dr Basil Elmasri)
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Product Content}
Configuration would include the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy and reliability of separation of programming plans by members.
    \item How easy to download all the documentation, report or code from gitlab.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Deviations and Waivers}
Deviations from the original plan included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented Route Calculations using Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth
    \item Changed our 3D Model from a directional arrow to a navgational line
    \item Implemented outside commercial spaces instead of within a museum setting - to deliver applicable concept
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase Rollout}
Phase I
\begin{itemize}
    \item Map showing user's current location
    \item Route calculations
    \item Superimposed 3D directional line
    \item Display navigation
\end{itemize}
Phase II
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show nearest museums to the user's current location
    \item Camera recognition of exhibits
    \item Request and pull information about exhibit
    \item Display the information
\end{itemize}
Phase III
\begin{itemize}
    \item Account database
    \item Registered users can store their visited museums
    \item User can rate and review the visited museums
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notification of Deplpoyment}
After the application is successfully released, a notification will be sent to stakeholders and clients.\\
Steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check all procedures and ensure everything is done.
    \item Email client for meeting.
    \item Present the client with the application.
    \item Sign off development plan documents.
    \item Email client with application information.
    \item Release of project and approval of supervisor.
\end{enumerate}
