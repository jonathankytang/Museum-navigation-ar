\section*{Quotes from field research}
\subsection*{Statement 1}
Visitor I - "Doesn't change the experience for me, maps are helpful already"\\
Visitor H - "Big tech companies haven't produced products like that"\\
Staff L - "If successful, it will raise the overall visitor count"

\subsection*{Statement 2}
Visitor G - "Exhibits with QR codes allows me to look at more details for a particular work of art"\\
Visitor D - "Want device to recognise what exhibit I am looking at"\\
Staff L - "Takes away the need for human interaction"

\subsection*{Statement 3}
Visitor B - "Takes away immersive experience and distracting"\\
Visitor G - "Don't like having mobile phone out in a museum"\\
Visitor C - "If app was free of charge, more people would use that instead of paying for maps - particularly those in younger generations"\\
Staff N - "Simple to use detract experience, make their current jobs harder and target market"

\subsection*{Statement 4}
Visitor E - "Will allow to me plan journey more efficient"\\
Visitor I - "Great to navigate museum with a mobile phone, don't need to ask strangers for help"\\
Visitor F - "Didn't have much information available on hand"\\
Staff M - "Too many questions and about the app foreseen, retracts experience for museum-goers"

Snippets from meetings with the project's domain expert
\subsection*{GPS}
\begin{itemize}
	\item GPS indoor not very reliable
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bluetooth}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bluetooth beacon
		\begin{itemize}
			\item estimate
			\item proximity beacon
			\item not to the absolute distance
		\end{itemize}
	\item most cost effective
	\item through raspberry pi
	\item individual desk level/25m range
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Optical Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Rear/forward facing for marker like QR code
	\item All stored locally on device
	\item Lo-fi solutions
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Other things}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Indoor challenge not completely met currently (e.g. by Google)
	\item Infra-red approach, differency frequency \& delta
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Point A to point B, not cost effective
		\end{itemize}
	\item Estimate using accelerometer between markers
	\item 2D top-down map for displaying optimal route?
	\item Finite number of routes - do natively
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Calculate peak times in certain spaces
		\end{itemize}
	\item Work with environment \& orientation
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Know you fix beacons
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{QA}
For UX
\begin{itemize}
	\item A/B testing
	\item In field testing
	\item Azure wireframing prototypes
\end{itemize}

Development
\begin{itemize}
