\section{Development Methodology}
% words can be trimmed down here
In order to produce high-quality software, a development methodology must be selected to monitor, and control all aspects of the project that is deliverable according to the stakeholder requirements within the expected milestones. 

Six variables were identified that should be managed throughout the project \cite{prince2}. The \textbf{cost} of the project has to be affordable, and need to factor actions that lead to overspending, or opportunities to cut cost. Allied to this, \textbf{time} is the only cost in the project. Ensuring the product delivers on its \textbf{quality}, and is fit for purpose along with the \textbf{scope} where there is an agreement between stakeholders on the deliverables. It is important not to deliver beyond the scope as this is a common source of delays, overspends and uncontrolled change, known as 'scope creep'. Managing the impact of \textbf{risks} is essential, but to assess how much risk there is, and what can be done is of importance. Finally, maintaining the \textbf{benefits} of the stakeholders is of particular interest so that there is a clear understanding of the purpose.

With these factors in mind, the waterfall, agile, and lean methodologies were considered for the project. Waterfall is a fixed sequential framework where it is linear in nature. Each of the eight processes in waterfall needs to be completed before moving onto the following stage. Despite the easy understanding of the methodology due to strong documentation approaches, this did not suit the project as changes cannot be easily accommodated \cite{smartsheet}. If there were errors during the implementation stage discovered during testing, then it would be expensive and difficult to go back. Further, there is greater reliance over the initial requirements; if these are incorrect they can be detrimental to the project. 

Lean focuses on removing waste from a process in order to deliver products quicker, lowering delivery costs without sacrificing quality, and providing a flexible response to users. This model narrows down to completing the minimal viable product (MVP) before considering extra features or content, though sometimes the full potential of the project is not reached. Similar to waterfall, the documentation needs to be explicitly precise in the requirements. Further, there were many skills to be acquired by the team throughout the project, and learning on to go is not possible in lean.

Agile is an iterative, incremental approach that is open to changing requirements with frequent feedback from end users. By breaking down the project into small chunks, it makes it easy to prioritise and add or drop features mid product, which is impossible in traditional waterfall projects. There is a requirement to adopt a more responsive, test and learn approach to the development activities. Breaking down tasks into iterations can allow the team to concentrate on high quality implementation. Such an approach delivers measurable results quickly, engages stakeholders earlier, and facilitates a more frequent and reliable product release cycle. However, due to the quick space of the process, the quality of the delivered software could decrease.

With these benefits in Agile, the team decided to adopt the agile methodology with the scrum framework. Scrum allows for a highly adaptive change in requirements during the entire cycle, and high transparency. The product owner is constantly in touch with the team \cite{globalluxsoft}, and daily stand-up meetings eliminates any misconceptions and confusion. Risk is controlled since issues are identified in advance before getting unmanageable. Kanban was not used since the project required iteration, and prioritising tasks on hand is harder with a Kanban board as all tasks are placed at equal importance with this framework.

\section{Software Development Life Cycle}
In the scrum team, the project supervisor served as the product owner where they were responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the development team. This ensures that the end product delivers value to the end user. The project lead took on the role of scrum master to ensure that stakeholder requirements were met, and to be accountable for the delivery of the sprint goals. The scrum master also took on the role to set and adjust the priorities of the product backlog since they had a greater understanding of the project than the product owner. Having a flat line structure allowed the development team to be self-organising and cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create the product increment. According to the framework, scrum recognises no sub-teams in the development team \cite{schwaber}, and this was avoided during implementation. This was so the whole team is accountable for all actions rather than those who have specialised areas of focus. Further, this allowed us to be dynamic in allocating resources to certain tasks when problems arose.

    \label{fig:scrumworkflow}
\end{figure}

Scrum events took place such as sprint planning, daily scrum, review, retrospective, and backlog refinement. Sprint planning always took place on the first day of the sprint where three key indicators are outlined, what can get done in the sprint, how the work is done, and the sprint goal \cite{schwaber}, providing the development team an objective. This event usually lasts about one to two hours for a two week sprint. Due to careful planning at the start of every sprint, this led to successful sprints during implementation and being able to deliver on requirements.

Conducting daily scrum proved challenging from the beginning as members were not always on campus at the same time; to resolve this, stand-up would take place almost every two days, and at least four times a week. In both terms at the start of every lab, and every supervisor meeting a ten minute stand-up would happen in person. The other two meetings would happen virtually on \url{appear.in} for ten minutes, the day before a milestone deadline (Thursday), and either Saturday or Sunday - depending on the group's availability. Using this model allowed for quick decision-making, and removing any obstacles the team faced.

A sprint review took place to audit the work completed, the positives, negatives, and problems of the sprint. At this point, the group would decide if the tasks assigned were at a "done" status, subject to review of the product owner. All requirements that were outlined within a reasonable time constraint must be reached to achieve this status. If there are any outstanding tasks to be completed, then this would filter through to the following sprint planning, and the product backlog will be edited accordingly. This formed part of the sprint retrospective, but mainly focused on how well the team administered the methodology. Other key stakeholders are consulted here, giving any important feedback to the completed work.

The team used a scrum board in order to track tasks and make any changes during sprints. This promoted transparency amongst the group, and ensured accountability was retained. The project used other scrum artifacts discussed in chapter five. Overall, the execution of the Agile methodology was good, since two members of the team had worked together in projects using Agile in industry - leading to a greater understanding by everyone of how it works. However, during the first two sprints the scrum master was involved in the sprints themselves, and that lead to work not meeting requirements. This was rectified in the remaining sprints, where timely interventions at impediments took place by them so that momentum was conserved, and the outlined requirements were achieved.

\section{Test-Driven Development (TDD)}
Another development methodology used was TDD. Before completing implementation for the sprint, the unit tests were written so that the focus when writing source code is to make all the tests pass. This allows for the software architecture to be thought out beforehand, and ensure that the core functionality is acting on the requirements. Also, this methodology is proved to reduce defect density, and reduces cost since the testing time is dramatically reduced \cite{bulajic}. Further, TDD fits into Agile's iterative approach, providing ease of allocating resources in sprints, and all developers have a great understanding in this.

Business-driven development, and acceptance test-driven development were considered, but a more thorough and rigorous testing system that focused mainly on the implementation was favored to deliver a working MVP.
