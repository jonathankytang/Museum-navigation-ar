Hamza Week 2

The use of mobile augmented reality by consumers, and research in the field has become more prominent in the last decade. This has allowed for completely new approaches in solving current problems using this technology as there is a year-on-year increase on smartphone users across the world. Therefore, as a navigation-based application for smartphones that is appropriate for the application of augmented reality technology, the study develops a museum navigation system. Museums are complex commercial spaces that have many intricacies in its architecture, making it very easy for visitors to lose their sense of direction. Therefore, these complex buildings are suitable for applying the augmented reality technology with the additional challenge of mapping user location in real-time. Even though museums have increasing popularity, with eight of the top ten visitor attractions in the UK being museums, current solutions to indoor navigation within these attractions only consist of 2-D paper maps; thus, they lack a sense of realism. Thereupon, this project develops an augmented reality navigation system for museums that can provide users with real-time directions to their desired location.
